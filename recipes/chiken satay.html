            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Satay, considered to be a national dish of Indonesia, is a popular Southeast Asian street food that usually involves a marinated meat being skewered and grilled, then served with a simple saucy dip.</p>
                <p>Depending on the region, there are countless variations of satay, with different kinds of meats, marinades, spices, and even skewer material. </p>

                <p>We're using flavorful chicken thigh meat here, but you can substitute anything from breast meat, to pork or beef, or even tofu and vegetables, though cooking times will vary.</p>
                <p>And that peanut sauce? Absolutely essential to the eating experience. It's the ultimate wingman to satay, containing all the fragrant notes of lemongrass, coconut, fish sauce, and fresh lime zest.
