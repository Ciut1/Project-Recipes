            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>One of Malaysia's better-known dishes is beef rendang, a slow-cooked dry curry deeply spiced with ginger and tumeric, kaffir lime and chilis. (You'll find chicken, vegetable, and seafood rendang as well.)</p>

                <p>In Malaysian fashion, it fuses sweet, sour, and savory elements, the curry picking up a creamy richness from two forms of coconut and an elusive tang from asam keping, slices of a sour sun-dried fruit.

                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound sirloin, sliced into half-inch chunks (any lean stewing beef can be substituted)</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cup coconut milk</li>
                    <li>1 cup water</li>
                    <li>1 turmeric leaf, tied into knot (can be omitted)</li>
                    <li>2 kaffir lime leaves, torn</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                    <li>1-2 pieces asam keping</li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>If using day-old rice, transfer rice to a bowl and break rice up with your hands into individual grains.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add spice paste and cook, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the wok or pan to prevent the paste from burning, until a pungent smell permeates your kitchen and the paste turns a few shades darker, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium at any time if the paste appears to be browning too quickly.</li>
                    <li>Add rice to the wok and stir to coat with the spice paste. Add kecap manis and soy sauce. Stir and cook until rice is evenly colored and hot throughout. Season with salt and white pepper.</li>
                    <li>Divide rice between two plates and top each plate of rice with a fried egg. Garnish with cucumber and tomato slices and shower with fried shallots, if you like. Serve immediately with kecap manis alongside for drizzling.</li>
